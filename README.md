Earthquake Magnitude Prediction using Ensemble Learning
This project aims to predict earthquake magnitudes using Ensemble Learning neural networks. The code is written in Python and utilizes deep learning techniques to make predictions based on historical earthquake data.

Dataset Source
The dataset used for this project is the "Earthquake Dataset," which contains historical earthquake information. You can obtain this dataset from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usgs/earthquake-database].

Please download the dataset and place it in the same directory as the code files.

Dependencies
This project requires the following dependencies to be installed:

Python (>=3.6)
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
TensorFlow (or Keras, which is included in TensorFlow 2.x)
You can install these dependencies using pip:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow



Getting Started
Follow these steps to run the code and make earthquake magnitude predictions:

Clone the repository or download the code to your local machine.

Download the earthquake dataset from the provided source and place it in the same directory as the code files.

Open the earthquake_magnitude_prediction.py script in your preferred Python development environment.

Modify the script if necessary to adjust hyperparameters or other settings.

Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python earthquake_magnitude_prediction.py
The script will load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the Ensemble Learning model, and make predictions. The results and evaluation metrics will be displayed in the console and saved in the output files.
Project Description
This project uses Ensemble Learning neural networks to predict earthquake magnitudes based on historical seismic data. The steps involved in the project are as follows:

Data Preprocessing:

Load the earthquake dataset.
Perform data cleaning and feature engineering.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Ensemble Learning Model Building:

Create an Ensemble Learning neural network model.
Define the model architecture and hyperparameters.
Compile the model with an appropriate loss function and optimizer.
Model Training:

Train the Ensemble Learning model on the training data.
Monitor training progress and adjust hyperparameters if needed.
Prediction:

Use the trained model to make earthquake magnitude predictions on the test data.
Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and visualizations.
Save Results:

Save the model weights and evaluation results for future reference.
Feel free to explore and customize the code to enhance earthquake magnitude prediction or adapt it to other time series prediction tasks.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to contact the project's maintainers.
